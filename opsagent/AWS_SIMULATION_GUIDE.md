# BOAT Agent AWS Simulation Guide

## 🎯 **YES, I can simulate the agent for you with your AWS credentials!**

This guide shows you exactly how to safely test BOAT with your real AWS credentials without deploying anything to Lambda.

## 🔒 **Security First**

Your credentials will be:
- ✅ Only used for this testing session
- ✅ Never stored or logged
- ✅ Used only for **read operations** by default
- ✅ Processed locally on your machine
- ✅ Automatically cleared after testing

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### Option 1: Interactive Setup (Recommended)
```bash
# Complete guided setup with credential input
make simulate-aws
```

### Option 2: Use Existing AWS Configuration
```bash
# If you already have AWS credentials configured
aws configure  # (if needed)
export CLAUDE_API_KEY="sk-ant-api03-..."  # (optional)

# Run specific simulations
make simulate-discovery    # Discover your AWS infrastructure
make simulate-cost        # Analyze deployment costs  
make simulate-deployment  # Test complex deployments
make simulate-interactive # Interactive exploration
```

## 🎭 **Available Simulations**

### 1. **AWS Infrastructure Discovery** (`make simulate-discovery`)
**What it does:**
- Discovers your actual VPCs and subnets
- Lists your ECS clusters
- Analyzes security groups
- Maps your network topology
- Provides deployment recommendations

**What you'll see:**
```
✅ AWS discovery completed successfully in 2.3s
📊 Your VPC Information Discovered:
  • VPC: vpc-12345678 (default)
  • Subnets: 4 available across 2 AZs
  • Security Groups: 12 configured
  • ECS Clusters: 2 active
```

### 2. **Cost Analysis** (`make simulate-cost`)
**What it does:**
- Analyzes costs using your actual AWS pricing
- Checks free tier compliance
- Estimates deployment costs
- Provides optimization suggestions

**What you'll see:**
```
✅ Cost analysis completed successfully in 1.8s
💰 Cost Analysis Results:
  • Estimated monthly cost: $23.40
  • Free tier savings: $16.20
  • Load balancer: $16.20/month
  • ECS compute: $0 (within free tier)
```

### 3. **Complex Deployment Simulation** (`make simulate-deployment`)
**What it does:**
- Tests microservices deployment planning
- Validates container requirements
- Plans load balancer setup
- Estimates scaling requirements

**What you'll see:**
```
✅ Deployment simulation completed successfully in 4.1s
🚀 Deployment Plan Generated:
  • Services: 4 microservices
  • Load balancer: Application Load Balancer
  • Auto-scaling: Enabled
  • Health checks: Configured
```

### 4. **Interactive Exploration** (`make simulate-interactive`)
**What it does:**
- Chat-style interaction with your AWS account
- Real-time analysis of deployment scenarios
- Natural language queries about your infrastructure

**Example session:**
```bash
BOAT AWS Simulation> Deploy a React app with Redis cache
✅ Simulation completed successfully (took 1.2s)

BOAT AWS Simulation> What's the cost of high-availability setup?
✅ Simulation completed successfully (took 0.8s)

BOAT AWS Simulation> quit
```

## 🛡️ **Required AWS Permissions**

For **read-only testing** (safe), you need:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:DescribeVpcs",
        "ec2:DescribeSubnets", 
        "ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups",
        "ecs:ListClusters",
        "ecs:DescribeClusters",
        "sts:GetCallerIdentity"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

For **full testing** (with resource creation simulation):
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "cloudcontrol:*",
        "ec2:*",
        "ecs:*",
        "elasticloadbalancing:*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🔄 **How to Provide Credentials Securely**

### Method 1: During Interactive Setup
The simulation script will securely prompt for credentials and not display them.

### Method 2: Environment Variables
```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-key"
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-east-1"
export CLAUDE_API_KEY="sk-ant-api03-..."  # optional

make simulate-discovery
```

### Method 3: AWS CLI Configuration
```bash
aws configure
# Enter your credentials when prompted

make simulate-cost
```

- Live cost calculations based on your region
- Security group analysis
- Container deployment planning
- Cost optimization recommendations

### 🎯 **Performance Expectations:**
- Infrastructure discovery: 1-5 seconds

## 🚨 **Safety Features**

1. **Read-Only by Default**: Simulations only read your AWS infrastructure
2. **No Resource Creation**: Nothing gets deployed to your account
3. **Credential Isolation**: Credentials only exist during the session
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful failures if permissions are insufficient
5. **Timeout Protection**: All operations have reasonable timeouts
